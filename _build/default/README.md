Important to note: 

  At first we were doing well but when Byron tried to pull Tayseer’s part from the repo, it said to rebase. Byron rebased and basically deleted most of his code. In the end we decided to start again because we ruined the project.

    We started the project again, making two different branches plus the main one. We got scared so everything Byron pushed Tayseer just copy pasted from the repo instead of pulling. At the end we ended up working on Tayseer’s laptop, just to make sure we did not ruin it again!
